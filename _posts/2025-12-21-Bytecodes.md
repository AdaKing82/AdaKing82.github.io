# Byte,Bytecode,Bytecode file, Bytecode instructons

## Byte

Because of the digital circuit designing constraints, the computer counting system is based on binary code, which is only comprised of 0s and 1s.

| Binary | Decimal |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0      | 0       |
| 1      | 1       |
| 10     | 2       |
| 11     | 3       |
| 100    | 4       |
| 101    | 5       |

The rule of binary counting is 'carry over when reaching two'. The formula of converting binary to decimal is below.

```bash
dec = 2^(n-1)+x*2^(n-2)+...+x*2^0
```

For example, the binary code 1001 is the decimal `2^3+1 = 9`

In computer inside, a 0 or a 1 represents 1 bit. For instance, 101 is 3-bit.

A byte is 8 bits.

How many numbers can 1-byte  stand for?

0000 0000 ~ 1111 1111, converting to decimal yields 256 numbers, ranging from 0 to 255.

In the computer realm, the 256 numbers can used for different purposes. For example, each number corresponds a symbol when using in ASCII; while if they are used to calculate for integer, it stands or 0 to 255.

To conveniently read a byte, the hex-deciaml form is introduced. the corresponding relationship is below.

| Binary | Decimal | Hex-Decimal |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0000   | 0      | 0      |
| 0001   | 1      | 1      |
| 0010   | 2      | 2      |
| 0011   | 3      | 3      |
| 0100   | 4      | 4      |
| 0101   | 5      | 5      |
| 0110   | 6      | 6      |
| 0111   | 7      | 7      |
| 1000   | 8      | 8      |
| 1001   | 9      | 9      |
| 1010   | 10     | a      |
| 1011   | 11     | b      |
| 1100   | 12     | c      |
| 1101   | 13     | d      |
| 1110   | 14     | e      |
| 1111   | 15     | f      |

On the other hand, a hex-decimal number can be easily transfered to a binary code. such as

```
0xff --> 1111 1111
0xab --> 1010 1011
```

In a short word, 1-byte is consisted of 8 bits, and is normally represented by hex-decimal form. the 

## Bytecode

What the bytecode is the program encoding is based on the bytes. Taking a JVM reading bytecodes as an example, assuming there is a java source code, which is to print Hello world in the terminal.

```java
public class HelloWorld
{
    /**
     * The old standby!
     * @param args The parameters are ignored.
     */
    public static void main(String... args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

The .class file generated by `javac` is composed of 0s and 1s.

The alphabets or numbers which are adjacent is a byte in the form of hex-decimal. Those bytes at specific positions stand for different meaning accroding to the Java Virtual Machine Specification. The codes is called bytecodes.

## Bytecode file

The file generated by javac is bytecode file.

The content of a java bytecode file must follow the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

类型：Type

名称：name

数量：numbers

For example, the first 4 words stand for `magic`, which is used for distincting the file type and version.

## Bytecode instructions

On the previous article, we have already know about how the computer based on the stack works, it execute some calculations and memory-accessing operations on the basis of serveral instructions. Since the virtual machine is performed by pure software, the instructions can be totally implemented on platform independence. That is the pharse "Java is platform independent " we always hear from.

As the bytecode that have been previously described, 1 byte can indicate a number from 0 to 255. Java Virtual Machine takes some of bytes to serve as [operations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se11/html/jvms-6.html).

For instance, 0x1A implys pushing an integer number to the top of operating stack.

Some bytes in the file indicate the instructions.

The 3 bytes corresponds to the instructions below.

```
iload_0
iconst_2
if_icmpge
```

The content of a .class file can be  translated from a hex-decimal representation to readable characters lines by` javap` tool.

## Merits

First of all, computer is ordinarily designed to read bytes one by one, encoding bytes is fit with the data reading mechanism. It is obviously convenient to apply it in local machine or on the internet. Secondly, it is easy for developers to read binarys in the form of hex-decimal. Thirdly, the bytecodes is the target code for pure software mimc computer, which means the execution is platform independent. As a result, the programs built upon the bytecodes can be rapidly to run at any computer equipted with JVM.
